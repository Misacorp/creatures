## Now

- **PR #8** (branch `m6-look`): M6 look: visual system, self-hosted fonts, element icons, sprites for all creatures and bosses, fight stage (show, don't tell), animated loot reveal, drag-and-drop placement, creature lore and quirks (migration 13). Waiting for Misa to test on staging and merge.
- Production runs PR #7 (8cf2589).

## Next

1. After #8: redraw any sprites Misa flags (Ashmole and Gaiadrake are the weakest); sprite sheet script `apps/activity/scripts/sprite-sheet.mjs`.
2. Watch the first ranked week and first Festival in production.
3. WebSocket push for the live finale after a staging spike in real Discord.
4. Dependabot PR #2 (vitest 5): wait until `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` 1.4.x is 7 days old, then bump both together.

## Open questions for Misa

- Which sprites to redraw; DnD touch feel (long-press alternative).

## Notes for future agents

- Staging's last-week leet credits are simulated; real ones from 2026-10-11 on.
- `redirect: 'error'` is rejected by workerd; always use `'manual'`.
- Heavy statistical tests need the 30 s package timeout (engine, game) or 60 s (sim).
- Misa's artifacts: setup checklist `https://claude.ai/artifact/Co4LRr4AiLyCPU2juAHFHW` (db-backed tasks); overnight summary `https://claude.ai/artifact/BRuaFKN1Gf7uPaoT1bfjLT` (static page; lead agent republishes it from its scratchpad file `overnight.html`). Keep the overnight page short: only what's done, what's in progress, and questions for Misa.
